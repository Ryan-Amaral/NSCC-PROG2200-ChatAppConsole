<p>A project for an Advanced OOP class at NSCC. This program is a console based chat application that communicates over TCP/IP. This project is meant to be a stepping stone to the improved version made in a <a href="#">Windows GUI</a>.</p><br/>
<p>To run this program the server must first be started. To do this, the program must be started with the option '-server'. Without starting the server first the client will just exit. Once the server is started and the client starts the program, the connection is made on the default port. The two instances can then send messages back and forth. The 'i' key must be pressed to enter insert mode. When in insert mode, incomming messages are blocked, and all get chunked together and displayed once input mode is exited (by sending the message). For an improved version see <a href="#">Chat App (GUI)</a>.</p><br/>
